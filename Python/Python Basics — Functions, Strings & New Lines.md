# Python Basics — Functions, Strings & New Lines

## 1. Functions

A **function** is a reusable piece of code that performs a specific task.

One of the first Python functions I learned is:

```python
print()
```

The `print()` function is used to display information in the console.

For example:

```python
print("Hello world")
```

Here:

* `print()` → the function
* `"Hello world"` → a string passed into the function

---

## 2. Strings

A **string (`str`)** is text.

Strings are usually written inside quotation marks:

```python
"Hello world"
```

We can put a string inside the `print()` function:

```python
print("Hello world")
```

Output:

```text
Hello world
```

So the basic structure is:

```python
print("string")
```

---

## 3. Multi-Line Strings

Python also allows us to create a string that spans multiple lines.

We can use **triple quotation marks (`"""`)** for this.

```python
print("""Hi, My name is Parth
I'm new to Python""")
```

Output:

```text
Hi, My name is Parth
I'm new to Python
```

This is useful when we want multiple lines of text inside a single string.

---

## 4. Combining Multiple Strings

Python can also place multiple strings next to each other.

```python
print("Hi My name is Parth, " "I'm new to Python " "This is fun!")
```

Python combines the strings into one line.

Output:

```text
Hi My name is Parth, I'm new to Python This is fun!
```

### Adding spaces

If we want spaces between the strings, we need to include them inside the strings:

```python
"Parth, "
"I'm new"
```

Notice the space before the closing quotation mark in `"Parth, "`.

---

## 5. The New-Line Character `\n`

Python uses `\n` to create a **new line**.

For example:

```python
print("Hi, My name is Parth.\nI'm learning Python.")
```

Output:

```text
Hi, My name is Parth.
I'm learning Python.
```

The `\n` tells Python:

> Start the following text on a new line.

We can also use it when combining strings:

```python
print("Hi, My name is Parth.\n"
      "I'm learning Python.\n")
```

---

## 6. Repeating Strings

We can use the `*` operator to repeat a string multiple times.

For example:

```python
print("Error\n" * 5)
```

Output:

```text
Error
Error
Error
Error
Error
```

The `* 5` tells Python to repeat the string five times.

This works because Python allows strings to be multiplied by integers.

# Quick Notes

### `print()`

A function used to display information.

```python
print("Hello world")
```

---

### Strings

Text surrounded by quotation marks.

```python
"Hello world"
```

---

### Multi-Line Strings

Use triple quotation marks when you want a string to span multiple lines.

```python
"""Hello
World"""
```

---

### Combining Strings

Multiple strings can be placed next to each other.

```python
print("Hello " "World")
```

Output:

```text
Hello World
```

Add spaces inside the strings when needed:

```python
print("Hello " "World")
```

---

### New Line — `\n`

Use `\n` to move text to a new line.

```python
print("Hello\nWorld")
```

Output:

```text
Hello
World
```

---

### Repeating Strings

Use `*` with an integer to repeat a string.

```python
print("Hello\n" * 3)
```

Output:

```text
Hello
Hello
Hello
```
